# The Skills of a Tennis Champion : A Data Visualization Project in R

### Purpose
This project was made collaboratly as a final project for CSU Stanislaus Data Visualization course. 
It was intended to help us explore the the R language, along with other complex topics such as data mining and analysis.
We learned how to create and style graphs, as well as using R to process information.
My group and I chose to analyze close to 1000 rows of data with over 25 columns of information. 
The tennis tournements included those of Wimbledon, the US Open, Australlia Open, and French Open. 
Statistics for both male and female players were tracked, resulting in eight total files.
To simplify the information, two more files called mens.csv and womens.csv were created to hold all their respective information in a single location.
All these files can be found under the Tennis Data Folder.
The results of this study can be found in the project's PDF presentation through github.
